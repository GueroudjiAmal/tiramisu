The files in this folder are organized as follows:

General
    clean.sh : remove some useless files.
    compile_and_run_mkldnn.sh : compile mkldnn code and run it. 
    configure.h: define size of input matrices.

Tiramisu
    bn_layer_generator_tiramisu.cpp: Tiramisu code generator.

Wrapper
    wrapper_nn.cpp: wrapped file that calls the code generated by Tiramisu.

Intel MKLDNN
    bn_layer_generator_mkldnn.cpp: code that calls Intel MKL DNN batch normalization. 

To run this benchmark:

At the directory build/benchmarks/DNN/layers/bn execute 
    make 

wrapper_nn_bn executable will be created in the current directory. to compare the result of tiramisu with MKL DNN execute :
    ./compile_and_run_mkldnn.sh
then 
    ./wrapper_nn_bn

Execution results could be found in the text files : 
    mkldnn_result.txt
    tiramisu_result.txt
